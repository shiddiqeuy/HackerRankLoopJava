# Output Format

Print the answer to each test case in separate lines.

# Sample Input

2

0 2 10

5 3 5

# Sample Output

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046

8 14 26 50 98

# Explanation

In the first case:

1st term = 0+1*2 = 2

2nd term = 0+1*2 + 2*2 = 6

3rd term = 0+1*2 + 2*2 + 4*2 =14

and so on.
